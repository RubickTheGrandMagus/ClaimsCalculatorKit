"Terminal leave is applied for by an official or an employee who intends to sever his connection with his employer. Accordingly, the filling of application for terminal leave requires as a condition sine qua non, the employeeâ€™s resignation, retirement or separation from the service. It must be shown first that public employment ceased by any of the said modes of severances."
